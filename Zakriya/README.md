Q: What did you notice about registers and instructions? 

Ans:  Registers are limited in number and store data temporarily. Instructions are low-level and hardware-specific.  

Q: How is coding in Assembly different from Python?

Ans: Assembly is very closely related to machine language and requires step-by-step instructions, while Python is high-level, simpler, and much easier to use.  

Q: Why is Python easier/faster for building the same project?

Ans: In python fewer lines of code are required to achieve the same result.

Q: Which features of Python help abstraction (variables, functions, loops)?

Ans: Python supports variables, functions, and loops , which makes coding easier, faster, and more organized.  


Comparison Table

| Feature           | Assembly Example | Python Example | Notes |
|-------------------|------------------|----------------|-------|
| Variable storage  | Register (EAX)   | `x = 5`        | Python automatically handles memory. |
| Printing output   | `INT 21h`        | `print()`      | Python is more readable and portable. |
| Arithmetic        | `ADD AX, BX`     | `x + y`        | Python hides low-level details. |
